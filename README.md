# Calculator
Another assignment for The Odin Project

I basically quit after my proof of concept. This is just review so no point in waisting time on it.

This is what still needs to be done:
* address the float point math issue 
* clear the main number after you press = and before you start typing a new number.
* add listeners for key presses instead of using the mouse.

Other cool options 
* add a history options to see a log of sorts, make it scrollable and position to the bottom
* once = is press changed the previous line out to to show the math, Ex 1 + 2 = 3
